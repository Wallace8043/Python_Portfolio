## Python Fundamentals

```python
weight_kg = 60
```


```python
print(weight_kg)
```

    60



```python
weight_kg = 60.3
```


```python
patient_name = "Jon Smith"
```


```python
patient_id = "001"
```


```python
weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg
print(weight_lb)
```

    132.66



```python
patient_id = "inflam_" + patient_id
print(patient_id)
```

    inflam_001



```python
print(patient_id, "weight in kilograms:" , weight_kg)
```

    inflam_001 weight in kilograms: 60.3



```python
print(type(60.3))
print(type(patient_id))
```

    <class 'float'>
    <class 'str'>



```python
print("weight in lbs:" , 2.2 * weight_kg)
```

    weight in lbs: 132.66



```python
print(weight_kg)
```

    60.3



```python
weight_kg = 65.0
print("weight in kilograms is now:" , weight_kg)
```

    weight in kilograms is now: 65.0



```python

```
